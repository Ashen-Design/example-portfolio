# Example Portfolio
A simple mockup of a portfolio page for myself utilising various libraries, such as `animate.css` and `Vue.js`.

This particular project runs on Node.js.

## Usage
To run it, clone the repo, navigate to the folder, and run `node index.js` from the directory.

Then navigate to `localhost:8080` to see the webpages.
